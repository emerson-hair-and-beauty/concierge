<p>808 Base Gel is the beat drop your curls have been waiting for. Like its namesake bass drum that anchors every track, this gel creates the foundation that makes your whole style hit different.</p>
<p>The medium-hold formula strikes that perfect balance – strong enough to lock in your pattern but flexible enough to keep curls bouncy and touchable.

It's built to be your first layer, creating a frizz-fighting base that other products can build on.</p>
<p>Use it solo for simple, defined curls or stack it under MOUSSE DEF for next-level volume and hold. Your wash-and-go just got more reliable, your twist-out more defined, and your TWA more popping. This is the gel that turns good curl days into great ones – because every masterpiece starts with a solid foundation.</p>
