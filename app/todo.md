# Building Operations and Marketting

The purpose of this document is to outline the operational, and marketing factors we must consider for this venture. We shall start with  marketing, because it makes us money. Then we shall focus on product development (engineering and product) for it is engine. The operational goals are therefore the fuel for our product development, and marketting. Writing clearly about marketing can hep us uncover operational abstractions which translate to product development. These abstractions / first principles will be the building blocks of our operational system, a manual sort of. A turnkey solution that we apply to everything else. 

## Marketing operations: 

What is the objective of marketing? It is to tell a story to the public, or to a target audience. This in turn makes us money. Generally, marketing and sales follows a pipeline, the sales funnel.  And we can begin our operational evolution by looking at those pipeline. 

```js
 const remember: "The Sales funnel principle is probably a first principle of operations. Most functions in a given organization are funnels, or atleast they can be"
```

### The awareness stage: 

The major tool in my arsenal for this stage is writing. With my writing I can produce great content. So I ought to double down on that. Either that is for PBC, or my personal website. The operational process for this is as follows: 

1. Write in markdown. 
2. Commit to github, and show live on website in "captain's log". Treat the log like some sort of kanban board. First draft, ideas edit, syntax edit, published". Anything that gets on the published tab automatically gets pushed to the more forward facing part of the website. This could either be in the essays section, or the portfolio section, or hobbies setion. This publishing routine must be automated. Mediums for publishing are as follows:
    - Whatsapp broadcasts
    - Substack
    - Email
    - Website
3. Anything that gets published on the website must be evaluated for repurposing. 

### The consideration stage: 

The major tool in my arsenal for this stage is appointments. These could be purely networking, or educational. I could really monetize my writing by offering one on one coaching for AI, Programming, Hardware, or anything else I am doing. 

1. Everything on the website should have a CTA. 
2. The CTA should always lead to an outcome. Most likey an appointent.
